title: Fast Autonomous Robotic System-Level Design
description:  One semester graduate project work focused on systems-level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots, emphasizing dynamic behaviors, sensor integration, and reactive control using embedded processors. The projects leverage partial off-board computation, low-latency software, and noise-tolerant system architectures.

skills:
  - C++
  - Python
  - Hardware/software integration
  - Debugging
  - Soldering
  - Oscilloscope
  - Arduino

# Header 1
Used for the title (already generated automatically at the top)
## Header 2  
Use this for the header of each section
### Header 3
Use this to have subsection if needed

## Adding a hozontal line

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header

title: Fast Autonomous Robotic System-Level Design
description:  One semester graduate project work focused on systems-level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots, emphasizing dynamic behaviors, sensor integration, and reactive control using embedded processors. The projects leverage partial off-board computation, low-latency software, and noise-tolerant system architectures.

skills:
  - C++
  - Python
  - Hardware/software integration
  - Debugging
  - Soldering
  - Oscilloscope
  - Arduino
